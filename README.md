# Claude Code Learning Playground

A hands-on learning repository for mastering **Anthropic's Claude Code** to build production-grade, enterprise-quality software products.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a **prototyping playground** where I experiment with Claude Code to:

- Learn and master Claude Code's capabilities for professional software development
- Build and iterate on production-grade prototypes rapidly
- Explore best practices for AI-assisted enterprise software development
- Test architectural patterns and technology stacks
- Document learnings and approaches for future reference

## Philosophy

**Production-Quality from Day One**: Each prototype in this repository is built with enterprise standards in mind - proper documentation, testing strategies, security considerations, and scalable architecture. The goal is to learn how Claude Code can accelerate professional software development without compromising on quality.

## Current Prototypes

### 1. SOC Copilot (`soc-copilot/`)

An AI-powered Security Operations Center assistant for managing security alerts and incidents.

**Tech Stack:**
- Backend: Spring Boot 3.4, Java 21, PostgreSQL 16, Spring Security
- Frontend: React 19, TypeScript, Vite 7
- Tools: Maven, npm, Postman

**Features:**
- RESTful API for security alert management
- CRUD operations with validation
- PostgreSQL database integration
- Spring Security authentication
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Development automation scripts

See `soc-copilot/README.md` for detailed documentation.

## Learning Goals

- Master Claude Code for full-stack development

- **Node.js**: v25.2.1
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA (with Claude Code integration)

## Contributing to My Learning

This is a personal learning repository, but I document everything thoroughly to:
- Track my progress and evolution as a developer
- Share learnings with the community
- Create a reference for future projects
- Demonstrate capabilities to potential collaborators

## Resources

- [Claude Code Documentation](https://claude.com/claude-code)
- [Anthropic API Reference](https://docs.anthropic.com/)
- Each prototype includes detailed setup and development guides

## License

This is a personal learning repository. Individual prototypes may have their own licensing considerations depending on dependencies and intended use.
